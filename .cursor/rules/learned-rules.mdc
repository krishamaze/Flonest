Always learn from execution errors.
Whenever an error occurs — in build, runtime, or logic, etc — capture the error context, record its signature, and update this files
.cursor\rules\design-system.mdc ,
.cursor\rules\engineering-playbook.mdc
to prevent repetition.

### Primary Rule — No Temporary Patches
- "Temporary patches become permanent debt."
- Never ship quick fixes; every change must be a durable, production-grade solution.

## Maintenance Policy
- Those file must stay concise (<500 lines)
- Remove outdated/irrelevant sections regularly
- Keep only relevant to this specific project
- Expand by reference, not inline
- **Priority System**: Errors are ranked by frequency/impact (🔴 Critical → 🟡 Medium → 🟢 Low)
- **When error recurs**: Move it up in priority, increment occurrence count
- **Review monthly**: Demote errors that haven't occurred recently
