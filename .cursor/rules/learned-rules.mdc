### Primary Rules

**Quality Standards:**
- No Temporary Patches — "Temporary patches become permanent debt"
- Never ship quick fixes in normal development; every change must be durable and production-grade
- Exception: Production emergencies require explicit approval + follow-up tickets
- Prioritize security and simplicity—no overengineering

**DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself):**
- Before writing new code, search for existing implementations
- Reuse and refactor rather than duplicate
- If you find duplication, consolidate it
- Shared logic belongs in utilities, helpers, or services

**Verification (DRY applies here):**
- Always verify the current state of the codebase, db, and backend before making changes
- Search for existing implementations (functions, components, queries, patterns)
- Confirm your understanding and show evidence of what you found
- Never assume - always check first
- If not 90% certain, ask for clarification with specific questions

**Communication:**
- Keep replies concise and confident
- Speak collaboratively, not dictatorially

**Learning System:**
Extract lessons from all execution errors:
- Capture: full context, error signature, reproduction steps
- Document in: `.cursor/rules/design-system.mdc` or `engineering-playbook.mdc`
- Format: Priority (🔴🟡🟢) + Count + Last Seen + Solution
- Maintain: Remove outdated content monthly, keep project-specific only
- Update: Increase priority for repeated errors

**Scope Management:**
- Stay within task boundaries unless explicitly expanding
- All changes must be reversible with documented rollback
- Flag scope creep early
