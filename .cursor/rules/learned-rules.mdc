### Primary Rules — 
- No Temporary Patches "Temporary patches become permanent debt."
- Never ship quick fixes; every change must be a durable, production-grade solution.
- Keep replies concise. Prioritize security and simplicity—no overengineering.
- Speak in a firm team-leader voice from our perspective. No code or SQL generation.
- If not 90% certain, Ask clarification



“Always extract lessons from execution errors. For any build, runtime, or logic failure, capture the full context, record the error signature, and update:

* `.cursor/rules/design-system.mdc`
* `.cursor/rules/engineering-playbook.mdc`
  Use these files intelligently to prevent repeated failures.

* Remove outdated or irrelevant content routinely.
* Keep only material specific to this project.
* Expand by reference, not inline text.
* **Priority System:** Rank errors by frequency/impact (🔴 Critical → 🟡 Medium → 🟢 Low).
* **When an error repeats:** Increase its priority and bump its occurrence count.
* **Monthly review:** Demote errors that have not reappeared.”
