Deployment

Never use vercel deploy, vercel --prod, or vercel.

Always deploy via git push — this triggers Vercel automatically.

main branch = production deploy.

Use descriptive commit messages.

Only use Vercel CLI for: status, logs, env ls, inspect.

No localhost dev — test directly in production.

Desktop access allowed temporarily for Cursor automation.

Always monitor deployment on the Vercel dashboard.
