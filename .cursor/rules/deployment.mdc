Deployment

Never use vercel deploy, vercel --prod, or vercel.

Always deploy using git push — it triggers Vercel automatically.
main branch = production deployment.
After push, check deployment status and fix any errors immediately.

Use descriptive commit messages.

Only use Vercel CLI for: status, logs, env ls, inspect.

No localhost dev — test directly in production.

Desktop access allowed temporarily for Cursor automation.

Supabase Database Operations

ALWAYS use Supabase MCP for database operations. Never use Supabase CLI commands for migrations or database changes.

For migrations:
- Create migration file: Use CLI only (`npm run supabase:migration:new <name>`) to create the file
- Apply migration: ALWAYS use Supabase MCP `apply_migration` tool, never use `supabase db push` or CLI commands
- Query database: ALWAYS use Supabase MCP `execute_sql` tool
- List tables: ALWAYS use Supabase MCP `list_tables` tool
- Generate TypeScript types: ALWAYS use Supabase MCP `generate_typescript_types` tool
- View logs: ALWAYS use Supabase MCP `get_logs` tool

When deploying:
1. Create migration file locally using CLI: `npm run supabase:migration:new <name>`
2. Write migration SQL in the file
3. Apply migration using Supabase MCP: Use `apply_migration` tool in Cursor chat
4. Commit and push to git (Vercel deploys automatically)

Never run `supabase db push`, `npx supabase db push`, or any CLI database push commands.

Development


Design mobile-first (390px width, touch-friendly).


Use React functional components with hooks + TypeScript.


Ensure Supabase queries follow RLS and type safety.


Include loading + error states for all async tasks.


Validate forms and maintain consistent UI.


Use code splitting, lazy loading, and WebP images.


Track bundle size and performance metrics.


Keep formatting clean and consistent.


Prioritize performance optimization.
