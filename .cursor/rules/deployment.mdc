Deployment

Never use vercel deploy, vercel --prod, or vercel.

Always deploy using git push — it triggers Vercel automatically.
main branch = production deployment.
After push, check deployment status and fix any errors immediately.

Use descriptive commit messages.

Only use Vercel CLI for: status, logs, env ls, inspect.

No localhost dev — test directly in production.

Desktop access allowed temporarily for Cursor automation.
