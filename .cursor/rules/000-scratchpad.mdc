# PROJECT SCRATCHPAD (Pending Decisions)

This file acts as a **Short-Term Memory Buffer**.

It contains architectural decisions, stack choices, and lessons learned that have NOT yet been fully integrated into the Core Rulebook.

## INSTRUCTION FOR AI (Senior Dev)

* **Read:** Check this file for recent decisions that might override older rules.

* **Write:** If the user makes a decision (e.g., "Use Zustand"), **Append** it here immediately.

## 📥 PENDING ATOMS (Decisions waiting for Librarian)

* *(Empty - No pending decisions)*
