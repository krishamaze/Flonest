# Engineering Playbook

> **Note:** This playbook has been decomposed into focused files for better token efficiency. See specialized files:
> - **Database/RLS**: `.cursor/rules/database-rls.mdc`
> - **Deployment**: `.cursor/rules/deployment.mdc`
> - **Security**: `.cursor/rules/security.mdc`
> - **Performance**: `.cursor/rules/performance.mdc`

## Primary Rule: No Temporary Patches
- "Temporary patches become permanent debt."
- Never ship quick fixes. Every change must be a durable, production-grade solution.

> **Note:** This rule also appears in `learned-rules.mdc` for code quality context. Engineering playbook focuses on deployment/infrastructure application.

## Documentation
- NEVER create `.md` documentation files unless explicitly requested.
- Communicate information via chat instead.

## Related Rules
- `@database-rls.mdc` — Database/RLS focused node you should load for SQL or Supabase issues.
- `@deployment.mdc` — Deployment workflows and verification steps.
- `@security.mdc` — Authentication and MFA security guardrails.
- `@performance.mdc` — UI performance patterns referenced by this hub.
