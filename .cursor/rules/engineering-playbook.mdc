# Engineering Playbook

## Primary Rule: No Temporary Patches
- "Temporary patches become permanent debt."
- Never ship quick fixes. Every change must be a durable, production-grade solution.

# 🔴 CRITICAL PRIORITY

## [P1] Supabase Migrations & DDL
- **Error**: `ERROR: 25006: cannot execute CREATE TABLE in a read-only transaction`
- **Context**: The Supabase MCP connection is read-only for DDL.
- **Fix**: Use the Supabase CLI for migrations.
  - Create migration: `npm run supabase:migration:new <migration_name>`
  - Apply migration: `npx supabase db push --linked`
- **Prevention**: ALWAYS use the CLI for DDL changes. MCP is for data queries.

## [P1] Vercel Deployment Verification
- **Issue**: Pushed code is not live; Vercel shows "BUILDING" or an old version.
- **Fix**: After `git push`, verify the deployment status.
  1.  Use Vercel MCP `list_deployments` to get the latest deployment.
  2.  Use `get_deployment` to check its state.
  3.  Wait until the state is `READY`. If it's `ERROR`, check logs with `get_deployment_build_logs`.
- **Prevention**: Deployment is not complete until the state is `READY`.

## [P1] Security over Convenience
- **Principle**: Never compromise security for UX.
- **Examples**:
  - Use generic messages for password resets to prevent email enumeration.
  - Use generic signup success messages to avoid revealing email configuration status.
- **Rule**: If a security decision feels inconvenient, it's likely the correct one.

# 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

## [P2] Empty `database.ts`
- **Error**: `File '.../database.ts' is not a module`, causing widespread TypeScript errors.
- **Context**: `database.ts` is empty after a migration.
- **Fix**: Regenerate types: `mcp_supabase_generate_typescript_types()`. Ensure the output file is not empty.
- **Prevention**: Regenerate types after every migration.

## [P2] UI Not Scrolling
- **Error**: Content is cut off and the page doesn't scroll.
- **Context**: A parent container has `overflow: hidden` or a fixed height.
- **Fix**: Remove `overflow: hidden` and fixed heights from parent containers. Use `overflow-y: auto`.

## [P2] Stale State in React
- **Error**: UI doesn't update after an async `setState`.
- **Fix**: Use functional updates for dependent state: `setState(prev => ...)`. Use `useEffect` to react to state changes.

# General Guidelines

## Update Detection System
- A Service Worker automatically detects new builds by comparing bundle hashes.
- No manual versioning is needed (`package.json`, `version.ts`, etc.).
- A pull-to-refresh gesture triggers an update check.

## Development
- Design mobile-first (390px width).
- Use React functional components with hooks and TypeScript.
- Ensure all async operations have loading and error states.
- Prioritize performance: code splitting, lazy loading, and WebP images.

## Documentation
- NEVER create `.md` documentation files unless explicitly requested.
- Communicate information via chat instead.
